/speckit.implement the next best task in the
@specs/008-c64-wasm-emulator/plan.md and @specs/008-c64-wasm-emulator/tasks.md.
Make sure to study the linked spec file and other relevant docs for the task.
Your task is to complete the whole (single) task and validate that you completed
it fully.

In general, "a task" in this context means a group of markdown checklists that
are a part of a "###" heading. If the group of tasks are all reasonably similar,
then do them all together as "the task".

IMPORTANT:

- Update the plan.md file with your current status after you complete work. It's
  a living document and you should check off completed work, change the list if
  we learn new or different work that must be completed.
- You should check previous commits to see work that was done recently to get
  context.
- After you complete a task, commit your work in a nice, detailed commit message
- Don't assume that the /specs folder is totally up to date with the actual code
  base. The code is the current state, so make sure to fully research the code
  when needed.
- The c64 project should live entirely in a sub-crate that will utilize the
  parent lib6502 crate.
- Always look at uncommitted work to check if there's work that needs to be
  finished or committed before picking up the next task
